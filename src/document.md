# Education

## In high school, how did you fare in mathematics and physical sciences? Which were your strongest subjects in the hard sciences, and how did you rank in your class?
I was a top student in mathematics and physical sciences. In high school, I prepared myself for the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO). We had study groups and the school supported us. In the third and fourth years of high school (equivalent to Graes 11th and 12th in Canada), I started teaching math to younger students to help them prepare for the IMO. I did not make it to the national team but I am very happy with the kind of math I studied at high school. In the university enterance exam, I was the top student in the school and second best in the city. I ranked 42nd nationwide among 300,000 applicants.

## In high school, what leadership roles did you take on?
I was part of the leadership team for organizing math classes for students who were interested in the International Mathematics Olympiad. The school gave us permission to have our classes one hour before the regular classes. We were motivated. Some of us passed the first round of nationwide exams but none of us made it to the national team. However, what we started became a movement for our city. A couple of years later, we had students from our city in the national team, a team with the likes of [Maryam Mirzakhani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Mirzakhani).

## What courses and university did you choose, and why?
Both of my parents were math teachers at high school. I could choose any university I wanted because of my rank in the nationwide enterance exam. After talking to my parents and older friends, I decided to study Electrical Engineering with a focus on Control Systems. My main interest was math. I also wanted to have better career opportunities. I therefore decided to study control theory and engineering as one of the closes fields to applied mathematics. I also chose the top engineering school in our country. Quite a few of our professors were graduates of MIT, Stanford and other top universities.

## How did you rank competitively in university? Which were your strongest courses, and which did you enjoy the most?
I entered Electrical Engineering/Control Systems as the top student nationwide. Staying number one, however, was very difficult as my classmates were the top students from all over the country. I graduated the 3rd student in the Control Systems option. During my undergraduate studies, I really liked these courses: Electrical Circuits, Signals and Systems, Logic Circuits, Microprocessors, Linear Control Theory, Modern Control, Industrial Control and Nonlinear Control. I was very strong in Microprocessors, Signals and Systems, Linear Control Theory and Nonlinear Control.

## In high school and at university, describe any achievements considered exceptional by colleagues and staff.
In general, I was really strong in math and numerical computations. For the nationwide university exam, I studied really hard for a long time and it paid off. In total, after two rounds of exams, I ranked 42nd in 300,000 applicants in the whole country. At university, it was really difficult to impress anyone because the majority of top 100 students in the country were my classmates. Having said that, I was really good with MATLAB programming. I could do almost anything in one line of MATLAB code. I regret it now and I wish I had not used MATLAB to the extent that I did.
